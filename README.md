# starColors
Colormaps from Visit, matplotlib, seaborn, etc. in Star-CCM+ format.

Default for most of those programs is a linear interpolation, so change Star-CCM+ Color Bar setting "Ramp Type" to "Linear" for best match. Can also change "Levels" to 256 or whatever.

For matplotlib and seaborn, took out 11 equally-spaced control points. So may not be perfect but should be visually extremely similar.
