# starColors
Colormaps from Visit, matplotlib, seaborn, etc. in Star-CCM+ format.

Default for most of those programs is a linear interpolation, so change Star-CCM+ Color Bar setting "Ramp Type" to "Linear" for best match. Can also change "Levels" to 256 or whatever.

Note that for "continuous" mappings like e.g. viridis, only 11 control points were used for simplicity. Should be close enough for basic viewing but just FYI.
